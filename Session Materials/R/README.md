# R Tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks for Reproducible Research
* The story revolves around image processing in R

## General outline

1.  Introduction, history and perspective (basically general context)
2.  Jupyter notebook inner workings in the context of the R kernel (`IRkernel` package)
*  Tour of Notebooks and Short Image Analysis Lab
  * Become familiar with the anatomy of notebooks
  * Learn how to efficiently navigate and work with notebooks
  * Gain some practice using shortcuts
  * Perform a short image analysis lab
*  Reproducible research - how Jupyter and R can address this
*  Expanded image analysis lab
  * Become comfortable building out a solution in notebooks with R and making it reproducible
  * Gain/regain the experience of a "hackathon" style lab involving collaboration
  * Become more comfortable and familiar with the notebook shortcuts and tools
  * Get some experience doing image color quantization
*  Microsoft Azure and Jupyter notebooks (they've got a few services available)
*  Teaching, training and workshoping with Jupyter notebooks
*  Wrap up


## What's so special about Jupyter notebooks?

* Jupyter's power is in having code, data, and text all accessible from **one file viewed in a browser**, living locally or in the cloud.  
* The Jupyter Project used to be part of the IPython Project and has spun off.  
* It supports over 40 different languages (see this [article](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages)) and that is actively growing.

## Text bits (non-code cells)

The text in a notebook is written in the simple __markdown__ language, making it a rich format capable of "rendering" latex, links, images and even html (since we're in a browser and the R kernel let's us).  

## The "new" wave on the block (at least R-flavored notebooks)

Amazing fact: in 2014, there were 80,000 jupyter notebooks on github.  In 2015 the number almost tripled to 230,000.  This shows how popular and fast-growing the usage is in the community.
